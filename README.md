# DBMS_Project

This project is a comprehensive **Database Management System** for handling a recruitment and sales workflow, built as part of UT Dallas course CS4347.

##  Tech Stack
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Database schema, views, normalization to 3NF
- **Python** – Console-based CRUD operations using PyMySQL
- **ER Diagrams & Relational Schemas** – EERD, logical/physical designs

##  Features
- Designed a normalized schema with 20+ related entities: `Employee`, `Customer`, `Job Application`, `Interview`, `Product`, `Vendor`, etc.
- Implemented SQL scripts for schema creation, data population, and real-world business queries.
- Built a Python console interface for basic operations like employee salary entry, job tracking, and part/vendor handling.

##  Concepts Applied
- 3NF Normalization
- Complex joins, subqueries, aggregation
- Views, constraints, and foreign key logic

##  Project Files
- `Project.sql` – All SQL DDL and DML scripts
- `Console.py` – Python CRUD interface
- `EERD.png`, `Relational_Schema.png`, `Physical_Schema.png` – Design documents
